    "###  **Selected Dataset**\n",
    "**Add Health High School Social Network Dataset**  \n",
    "- Source: [UCI Network Data Repository – Add Health](http://moreno.ss.uci.edu/data.html#addhealth)  \n",
    "- Description: This dataset contains friendship nomination data from a high school in Columbus, Ohio, collected as part of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Why This Dataset Works**\n",
    "-  **Available on the web**: Publicly accessible from the University of California, Irvine website.\n",
    "-  **Categorical variables** for each node:\n",
    "  - **Gender** (Male, Female)\n",
    "  - **Grade level** (7th–12th)\n",
    "  - **Race**\n",

    "###  **High-Level Plan to Load and Prepare the Data**\n",
    "1. **Download files** from the UCI repository:\n",
    "   - `.net` or `.gml` files contain the friendship network (nodes and edges).\n",
    "   - Accompanying metadata files include categorical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load the network** using Python and NetworkX:\n",
    "   - Use `nx.read_pajek()` or `nx.read_gml()` to import the network structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Attach categorical metadata** to each node:\n",
    "   - Parse the metadata file and map gender, grade, and race to node IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate centrality measures**:\n",
    "   - Degree Centrality\n",
    "   - Eigenvector Centrality\n",
    "   - (Optionally) Betweenness or Closeness Centrality\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Group nodes** by categorical variables and compare centrality scores across groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Hypothetical Outcome to Predict**\n",
    "> **Hypothesis:** Students with higher **degree centrality** (i.e., those who receive more friendship nominations) are more socially integrated and possibly more popular within their peer group.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could predict:\n",
    "- **Social integration level** based on **degree centrality**, and compare it:\n",
    "  - Across **gender** (e.g., do female students have higher centrality on average?)\n",
    "  - Across **grade level** (e.g., are seniors more central than freshmen?)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Conclusion\n",
    "This dataset and approach provide a rich opportunity to explore how **network position** relates to **social standing**, using real-world categorical group comparisons. The full implementation of this analysis will be completed in **Project 1**.\n",

    "and analysis will follow in Project 1."
