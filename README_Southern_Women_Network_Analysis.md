# Southern Women Network Analysis

This project analyzes the **Southern Women Dataset**, a classic bipartite network that captures the attendance of 18 women at 14 social events in a Southern U.S. town in 1930s. Originally studied in 1941, this small but rich dataset is frequently used to explore social network structures, centrality, and community formation.

## Dataset Description

- **Nodes**: 18 women + 14 events = 32 nodes
- **Edges**: Represent attendance (i.e., a woman attended a particular event)
- **Source**: Built-in `networkx.davis_southern_women_graph()` dataset

This is a **bipartite graph** consisting of two distinct node sets:
- Set 1: Women
- Set 2: Events

---

##  Objectives

- Explore and visualize the bipartite network of women and events
- Compute and compare centrality measures for both women and events
- Detect community structures among women
- Draw conclusions about social dynamics based on attendance patterns

---

##  Methods Used

- **Python Libraries**: `networkx`, `matplotlib`
- **Bipartite Graph Analysis**
- **Degree Centrality**
- **Projection onto single-mode network (Women-Women)**
- **Community Detection using Greedy Modularity**

## Key Findings

### Relationships between Women
- Women who attended the same events formed tightly connected clusters.
- Central women (e.g., Evelyn, Brenda) attended more events and acted as social bridges.
- Communities reflect social cliques based on shared event participation.

### Relationships between Events
- Events like E7, E8, and E9 were highly attended and served as key meeting points.
- Central events often brought together women from different clusters.
